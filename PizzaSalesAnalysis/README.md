## Key Visualizations

### 1. % of Sales by Pizza Category
A donut chart showing the proportion of total revenue contributed by each pizza category (e.g., Classic, Veggie, Chicken, Supreme).

### 2. % of Sales by Pizza Size
A donut chart showing the percentage of total revenue generated by each pizza size (Small, Medium, Large, etc.).

### 3. Daily Trend for Total Orders
A line chart visualizing the number of unique orders placed each day. This helps identify daily peaks and trends over time.

### 4. Hourly Trend for Total Orders
A bar chart displaying the number of orders per hour (0–23), which highlights peak operational hours.

### 5. Top 5 Best-Selling Pizzas per Category
